**Learn how to implement source generators and gRPC in your Blazor apps for better performance**

## What is this book about?
Want to stand out from the crowd using a book that is as performant and lightweight as the fantastic framework that it’s about? You’re in luck.
Building Blazor WebAssembly Applications with gRPC will take you to the next level in your web development career. After working through all the essentials of gRPC, Blazor, and source generators, you will be far from a beginner C# developer and would qualify as a developer with intermediate knowledge of the Blazor ecosystem.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Master routing and test your learning with demo applications
* Create service and controller classes for your API endpoints
* Use gRPC with Blazor instead of REST and revamp your applications
* Study partial classes, attributes, and more in source generators
* Write reusable Razor components and debug your code effectively
* Understand the semantic model of C# code
* Discover how to read and navigate through syntax trees
* Build dynamic websites without using JavaScript

All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
@{ var i = 0; }
@while (i < chapters.Length)
{
    var chapter = chapters[i];
    <h2>Chapter no. @chapter.Number: @chapter.Title</h2>
    i++;
}
```
